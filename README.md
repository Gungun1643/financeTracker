**Project Description**

During the **Microsoft GitHub Copilot Hackathon** hosted by **Techgig**, I participated in the event and worked on a project focused on building innovative solutions for real-world challenges faced by industries such as fintech, e-commerce, retail, and more. Leveraging the power of GitHub Copilot, I collaborated with a team of fellow developers to develop a cutting-edge solution.



## Features
Here are the main key features of the website 

**1: Summary Page with Provisional Balance and Budget Progress Pie Chart**

The Summary Page of our project offers users the ability to track their financial status conveniently. It includes a Provisional Balance, a **Budget Progress Pie Chart**, and the flexibility to edit the budget and income values.

This feature empowers users to customize and adapt their financial plan according to their specific needs. By allowing users to update these values, our project ensures accurate calculations of the provisional balance and budget progress.

The **Provisional Balance** is dynamically recalculated based on the edited budget and income values. The Budget Progress Pie Chart also adjusts accordingly, reflecting the changes in the budget utilization.

 This feature enhances the user experience, enabling users to manage their finances effectively and stay on top of their financial goals.

**2. Expense List with Category-Based Spending Breakdown:** 


The Expense List feature allows users to track expenses by category, amount, and date. Dynamic data fetching from MongoDB enables users to visualize spending patterns and identify categories with higher expenditure. A pie chart provides a clear breakdown of expenses, highlighting the proportion spent in each category.

This feature allows users to:

**Add Expenses:** Easily input expenses with category, amount, and date for storage in MongoDB.

**View Spending Breakdown:** Retrieve expense data from **MongoDB** and generate an interactive pie chart to visualize spending by category.

Powered by MongoDB and a charting library like **Chart.js**.



**3.  Investment Planning and Projected Savings**

The Goals feature enables users to set financial goals and offers investment planning for achieving them. By defining goals and timeframes, users can calculate monthly investment requirements and project potential savings.

Users can:

**Set Financial Goals:** Define goals with target amounts and desired timeframes.

**Investment Planning:** Calculate monthly investments needed to reach goals.

**Projected Savings:** Get estimates of potential savings based on planned investments.

This feature provides valuable insights and assistance for users' financial planning and decision-making.
